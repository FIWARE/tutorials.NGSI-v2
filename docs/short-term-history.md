**Description:** This tutorial is an introduction to [FIWARE STH-Comet](https://fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io/) - a
generic enabler which is used to retrieve trend data from a MongoDB database. The tutorial activates the IoT sensors
connected in the [previous tutorial](iot-agent.md) and persists measurements from those sensors into a database and
retrieves time-based aggregations of that data.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Short-Term-History/)

# Querying Time Series Data (MongoDB)

> "The _"moment"_ has no yesterday or tomorrow. It is not the result of thought and therefore has no time."
>
> â€” Bruce Lee

Within the FIWARE platform, historical context data can be persisted to a database (such as MongoDB) using a combination
of the **Orion Context Broker** and the **Cygnus** generic enabler. This results in a series of data points being
written to the database of your choice. Each time-stamped data point represents the state of context entities at a given
moment in time. The individual data points are relatively meaningless on their own, it is only through combining a
series data points that meaningful statistics such as maxima, minima and trends can be observed.

The creation and analysis of trend data is a common requirement of context-driven systems - therefore the FIWARE
platform offers a generic enabler ([STH-Comet](https://fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io/)) specifically to deal with the
issue of persisting and interpreting time series data persisted into MongoDB. **STH-Comet** itself can be used in two
modes:

-   In _minimal_ mode, **STH-Comet** is responsible for both data collection and interpreting the data when requested.
-   In _formal_ mode, the collection of data is delegated to **Cygnus**, **STH-Comet** merely reads from an existing
    database.

Of the two modes of operation, the _formal_ mode is more flexible, but _minimal_ mode is simpler and easier to set-up.
The key differences between the two are summarized in the table below:

|                                                        | _minimal_ mode                                    | _formal_ mode                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is the system easy to set-up properly?                 | Only one configuration supported - Easy to set up | Highly configurable - Complex to set up                         |
| Which component is responsible for a data persistence? | **STH-Comet**                                     | **Cygnus**                                                      |
| What is the role of **STH-Comet**?                     | Reading and writing data                          | Data Read only                                                  |
| What is the role of **Cygnus**?                        | Not Used                                          | Data Write only                                                 |
| Where is the data aggregated?                          | MongoDB database connected to **STH-Comet** only  | MongoDB database connected to both **Cygnus** and **STH-Comet** |
| Can the system be configured to use other databases?   | No                                                | Yes                                                             |
| Does the solution scale easily?                        | Does not scale easily - use for simple systems    | Scales easily - use for complex systems                         |
| Can the system cope with high rates of throughput?     | No - use where throughput is low                  | Yes - use where throughput is high                              |

## Analyzing time series data

The appropriate use of time series data analysis will depend on your use case and the reliability of the data
measurements you receive. Time series data analysis can be used to answer questions such as:

-   What was the maximum measurement of a device within a given time period?
-   What was the average measurement of a device within a given time period?
-   What was the sum of the measurements sent by a device within a given time period?

It can also be used to reduce the significance of each individual data point to exclude outliers by smoothing.

#### Device Monitor

For the purpose of this tutorial, a series of dummy IoT devices have been created, which will be attached to the context
broker. Details of the architecture and protocol used can be found in the [IoT Sensors tutorial](iot-sensors.md). The
state of each device can be seen on the UltraLight device monitor web page found at:
`http://localhost:3000/device/monitor`

![FIWARE Monitor](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Short-Term-History/img/device-monitor.png)

#### Device History

Once **STH-Comet** has started aggregating data, the historical state of each device can be seen on the device history
web page found at: `http://localhost:3000/device/history/urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Short-Term-History/img/history-graphs.png)

## Architecture

This application builds on the components and dummy IoT devices created in [previous tutorials](iot-agent.md). It will
use three or four FIWARE components depending on the configuration of the system: the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the
[IoT Agent for Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[STH-Comet](https://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[Cygnus](https://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Therefore, the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   Four **FIWARE Generic Enablers**:
    -   The FIWARE [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests
        using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2).
    -   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will
        receive northbound measurements from the dummy IoT devices in
        [Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        format and convert them to [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) requests for the
        context broker to alter the state of the context entities.
    -   FIWARE [STH-Comet](https://fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io/) will:
        -   interpret time-based data queries.
        -   subscribe to context changes and persist them into a **MongoDB** database (_minimal_ mode only).
    -   FIWARE [Cygnus](https://fiware-cygnus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) where it will subscribe to context changes and
        persist them into a **MongoDB** database (_formal_ mode only).

> **Note:** **Cygnus** will only be used if **STH-Comet** is configured in _formal_ mode.

-   A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database: + Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data
    information such as data entities, subscriptions and registrations + Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device
    information such as device URLs and Keys + Used as a data sink to hold time-based historical context data + In
    _minimal_ mode - this is read and populated by **STH-Comet** + In _formal_ mode - this is populated by **Cygnus**
    and read by **STH-Comet**.
-   Three **Context Providers**:
    -   The **Stock Management Frontend** is not used in this tutorial. It does the following:
        -   Display store information and allow users to interact with the dummy IoT devices.
        -   Show which products can be bought at each store.
        -   Allow users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.
    -   A webserver acting as set of [dummy IoT devices](iot-sensors.md) using the
        [Ultralight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        protocol running over HTTP.
    -   The **Context Provider NGSI** proxy is not used in this tutorial. It does the following:
        -   receive requests using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2);
        -   makes requests to publicly available data sources using their own APIs in a proprietary format;
        -   returns context data back to the Orion Context Broker in
            [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) format.

Since all interactions between the services are initiated by HTTP requests, the services can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

The specific architecture of both the _minimal_ and _formal_ configurations is discussed below.

## Start Up

Before you start you should ensure that you have obtained or built the necessary Docker images locally. Please clone the
repository and create the necessary images by running the commands as shown:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Short-Term-History.git
cd tutorials.Short-Term-History

./services create
```

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Short-Term-History/blob/master/services) Bash script provided within the
repository:

```bash
./services <command>
```

Where `<command>` will vary depending upon the mode we wish to activate. This command will also import seed data from
the previous tutorials and provision the dummy IoT sensors on startup.

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

---

## _minimal_ mode (STH-Comet only)

In the _minimal_ configuration, **STH-Comet** is used to persisting historic context data and also used to make
time-based queries. All operations take place on the same port `8666`. The MongoDB instance listening on the standard
`27017` port is used to hold data the historic context data as well as holding data related to the **Orion Context
Broker** and the **IoT Agent**. The overall architecture can be seen below:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Short-Term-History/img/sth-comet.png)

<h3>Database Server Configuration</h3>

```yaml
mongo-db:
    image: mongo:4.2
    hostname: mongo-db
    container_name: db-mongo
    ports:
        - '27017:27017'
    networks:
        - default
```

<h3>STH-Comet Configuration</h3>

```yaml
sth-comet:
    image: quay.io/fiware/sth-comet
    hostname: sth-comet
    container_name: fiware-sth-comet
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    ports:
        - '8666:8666'
    environment:
        - STH_HOST=0.0.0.0
        - STH_PORT=8666
        - DB_PREFIX=sth_
        - DB_URI=mongo-db:27017
        - LOGOPS_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

The `sth-comet` container is listening on one port:

-   The Operations for port for STH-Comet - `8666` is where the service will be listening for notifications from the
    Orion context broker as well as time based query requests from cUrl or Postman.

The `sth-comet` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key          | Value            | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STH_HOST     | `0.0.0.0`        | The address where STH-Comet is hosted - within this container it means all IPv4 addresses on the local machine |
| STH_PORT     | `8666`           | Operations Port that STH-Comet listens on, it is also used when subscribing to context data changes            |
| DB_PREFIX    | `sth_`           | The prefix added to each database entity if none is provided                                                   |
| DB_URI       | `mongo-db:27017` | The MongoDB server which STH-Comet will contact to persist historical context data                             |
| LOGOPS_LEVEL | `DEBUG`          | The logging level for STH-Comet                                                                                |

## _minimal_ mode - Start up

To start the system using the _minimal_ configuration using **STH-Comet** only, run the following command:

```bash
./services sth-comet
```

### STH-Comet - Checking Service Health

Once STH-Comet is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP request to the exposed `STH_PORT` port. If the
response is blank, this is usually because **STH-Comet** is not running or is listening on another port.

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8666/version'
```

#### Response:

> **Tip:** Use [jq](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-transform-json-data-with-jq) to format the
> JSON responses in this tutorial. Pipe the result by appending
>
> ```
> | jq '.'
> ```

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "version": "2.3.0-next"
}
```

> **Troubleshooting:** What if the response is blank ?
>
> -   To check that a docker container is running try
>
> ```
> docker ps
> ```
>
> You should see several containers running. If `sth-comet` or `cygnus` is not running, you can restart the containers
> as necessary.

### Generating Context Data

For the purpose of this tutorial, we must be monitoring a system where the context is periodically being updated. The
dummy IoT Sensors can be used to do this. Open the device monitor page at `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor` and
unlock a **Smart Door** and switch on a **Smart Lamp**. This can be done by selecting an appropriate the command from
the drop-down list and pressing the `send` button. The stream of measurements coming from the devices can then be seen
on the same page:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Short-Term-History/img/door-open.gif)

## _minimal_ mode - Subscribing STH-Comet to Context Changes

Once a dynamic context system is up and running, under minimal mode, **STH-Comet** needs to be informed of changes in
context. Therefore, we need to set up a subscription in the **Orion Context Broker** to notify **STH-Comet** of these
changes. The details of the subscription will differ dependent upon the device being monitored and the sampling rate.

### STH-Comet - Aggregate Motion Sensor Count Events

The rate of change of the **Motion Sensor** is driven by events in the real-world. We need to receive every event to be
able to aggregate the results.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the **Orion Context Broker**.

-   The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to
    measurements from the attached IoT Sensors.
-   The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that **STH-Comet** will be informed of all **Motion Sensor** data
    changes.
-   The notification `url` must match the configured `STH_PORT`.
-   The `attrsFormat=legacy` is required since **STH-Comet** currently only accepts notifications in the older NGSI v1
    format.

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Notify STH-Comet of all Motion Sensor count changes",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "idPattern": "Motion.*"
      }
    ],
    "condition": {"attrs": ["count"] }
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://sth-comet:8666/notify"
    },
    "attrs": [
      "count"
    ],
    "attrsFormat": "legacy"
  }
}'
```

### STH-Comet - Sample Lamp Luminosity

The luminosity of the **Smart Lamp** is constantly changing, we only need to **sample** the values to be able to work
out relevant statistics such as minimum and maximum values and rates of change.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the **Orion Context Broker** and including
the `throttling` attribute in the request body.

-   The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to
    measurements from the attached IoT Sensors.
-   The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that **STH-Comet** will be informed of all **Smart Lamp** data changes
    only.
-   The notification `url` must match the configured `STH_PORT`.
-   The `attrsFormat=legacy` is required since **STH-Comet** currently only accepts notifications in the older NGSI v1
    format.
-   The `throttling` value defines the rate that changes are sampled.

> **Note:** Be careful when throttling subscriptions as sequential updates will not be persisted as expected.
>
> For example if an UltraLight device sends the measurement `t|20|l|1200` it will be a single atomic commit and both
> attributes will be included the notification to **STH-Comet** however is a device sends `t|20#l|1200` this will be
> treated as two atomic commits - a notification will be sent for the first change in `t`, but the second change in `l`
> will be ignored as the entity has been recently updated within the sampling period.

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \

}'
```

## Time Series Data Queries

The queries in this section assume you have already connected **STH-Comet** using either _minimal_ mode or _formal_ mode
and have collected some data.

## Prerequisites

**STH-Comet** will only be able to retrieve time series data if sufficient data points have already been aggregated
within the system. Please ensure that the **Smart Door** has been unlocked and the **Smart Lamp** has been switched on
and the subscriptions have been registered. Data should be collected for at least a minute before the tutorial.

### Check that Subscriptions Exist

You can note that the `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers must be set in the query and match the values
used when setting up the subscription

#### 4 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

The result should not be empty.

## Offsets, Limits and Pagination

### List the first N sampled values

This example shows the first 3 sampled `luminosity` values from `Lamp:001`.

To obtain the short term history of a context entity attribute, send a GET request to
`../STH/v1/contextEntities/type/<Entity>/id/<entity-id>/attributes/<attribute>`

the `hLimit` parameter restricts the result to N values. `hOffset=0` will start with the first value.

#### 5 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8666/STH/v1/contextEntities/type/Lamp/id/Lamp:001/attributes/luminosity' \
  -d 'hLimit=3' \
  -d 'hOffset=0' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

                "reasonPhrase": "OK"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### List N sampled values at an Offset

This example shows the fourth, fifth and sixth sampled `count` values from `Motion:001`.

To obtain the short term history of a context entity attribute, send a GET request to
`../STH/v1/contextEntities/type/<Entity>/id/<entity-id>/attributes/<attribute>`

the `hLimit` parameter restricts the result to N values. Setting `hOffset` to a non-zero value will start from the Nth
measurement.

#### 6 Request:

```bash
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8666/STH/v1/contextEntities/type/Motion/id/Motion:001/attributes/count' \
  -d 'hLimit=3' \
  -d 'hOffset=3' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

#### Response:

```json

### List the latest N sampled values

This example shows latest three sampled `count` values from `Motion:001`.

To obtain the short term history of a context entity attribute, send a GET request to
`../STH/v1/contextEntities/type/<Entity>/id/<entity-id>/attributes/<attribute>`

If the `lastN` parameter is set, the result will return the N latest measurements only.

## Time Period Queries

### List the sum of values over a time period

This example shows total `count` values from `Motion:001` over each minute

To obtain the short term history of a context entity attribute, send a GET request to
`../STH/v1/contextEntities/type/<Entity>/id/<entity-id>/attributes/<attribute>`

The `aggrMethod` parameter determines the type of aggregation to perform over the time series, the `aggrPeriod` is one
of `second`, `minute`, `hour` or `day`.

Always select the most appropriate time period based on the frequency of your data collection. `minute` has been
selected because the `Motion:001` is firing a few times within each minute.

Querying for the mean value within a time period is not directly supported.

This example shows sum of `luminosity` values from `Lamp:001` over each minute. When combined with the number of samples
the within the time period an average can be calculated from the data.

To obtain the short term history of a context entity attribute, send a GET request to
`../STH/v1/contextEntities/type/<Entity>/id/<entity-id>/attributes/<attribute>`

The `aggrMethod` parameter determines the type of aggregation to perform over the time series, the `aggrPeriod` is one
of `second`, `minute`, `hour` or `day`.

### List the minimum of a value over a time period

This example shows minimum `luminosity` values from `Lamp:001` over each minute

To obtain the short term history of a context entity attribute, send a GET request to
`../STH/v1/contextEntities/type/<Entity>/id/<entity-id>/attributes/<attribute>`

The `aggrMethod` parameter determines the type of aggregation to perform over the time series, the `aggrPeriod` is one
of `second`, `minute`, `hour` or `day`.

The luminosity of the **Smart Lamp** is continually changing and therefore tracking the minimum value makes sense. The
**Motion Sensor** is not suitable for this as it only offers binary values.

## _formal_ mode (Cygnus + STH-Comet)

The _formal_ configuration is uses **Cygnus** to persist historic context data into a MongoDB database in the same
manner as had been presented in the [previous tutorial](historic-context-flume.md). The existing MongoDB instance
(listening on the standard `27017` port) is used to hold data related to the **Orion Context Broker**, the **IoT Agent**
and the historic context data persisted by **Cygnus**. **STH-Comet** is also attached to the same database to read data
from it. The overall architecture can be seen below:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Short-Term-History/img/cygnus-sth-comet.png)

<h3>Database Server Configuration</h3>

```yaml
mongo-db:
    image: mongo:4.2
    hostname: mongo-db
    container_name: db-mongo
    ports:
        - '27017:27017'
    networks:
        - default
```

<h3>STH-Comet Configuration</h3>

```yaml
sth-comet:
    image: quay.io/fiware/sth-comet
    hostname: sth-comet
    container_name: fiware-sth-comet
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    ports:
        - '8666:8666'
    environment:
        - STH_HOST=0.0.0.0
        - STH_PORT=8666
        - DB_PREFIX=sth_
        - DB_URI=mongo-db:27017
        - LOGOPS_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

<h3>Cygnus Configuration</h3>

```yaml
cygnus:
    image: quay.io/fiware/cygnus-ngsi:latest
    hostname: cygnus
    container_name: fiware-cygnus
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - '5080'
    ports:
        - '5050:5050'
        - '5080:5080'
    environment:
        - 'CYGNUS_MONGO_HOSTS=mongo-db:27017'
        - 'CYGNUS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG'
        - 'CYGNUS_SERVICE_PORT=5050'
        - 'CYGNUS_API_PORT=5080'
```

The `sth-comet` container is listening on one port:

-   The Operations for port for STH-Comet - `8666` is where the service will be listening for time based query requests
    from cUrl or Postman.

The `sth-comet` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key          | Value            | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STH_HOST     | `0.0.0.0`        | The address where STH-Comet is hosted - within this container it means all IPv4 addresses on the local machine |
| STH_PORT     | `8666`           | Operations Port that STH-Comet listens on                                                                      |
| DB_PREFIX    | `sth_`           | The prefix added to each database entity if none is provided                                                   |
| DB_URI       | `mongo-db:27017` | The MongoDB server which STH-Comet will contact to persist historical context data                             |
| LOGOPS_LEVEL | `DEBUG`          | The logging level for STH-Comet                                                                                |

The `cygnus` container is listening on two ports:

-   The Subscription Port for Cygnus - `5050` is where the service will be listening for notifications from the Orion
    context broker.
-   The Management Port for Cygnus - `5080` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make
    provisioning commands without being part of the same network.

The `cygnus` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                 | Value            | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CYGNUS_MONGO_HOSTS  | `mongo-db:27017` | Comma separated list of MongoDB servers which Cygnus will contact to persist historical context data |
| CYGNUS_LOG_LEVEL    | `DEBUG`          | The logging level for Cygnus                                                                         |
| CYGNUS_SERVICE_PORT | `5050`           | Notification Port that Cygnus listens when subscribing to context data changes                       |
| CYGNUS_API_PORT     | `5080`           | Port that Cygnus listens on for operational reasons                                                  |

## _formal_ mode - Start up

To start the system using the _formal_ configuration using **Cygnus** and **STH-Comet**, run the following command:

```bash
./services cygnus
```

### STH-Comet - Checking Service Health

Once **STH-Comet** is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP request to the exposed `STH_PORT` port. If the
response is blank, this is usually because **STH-Comet** is not running or is listening on another port.

#### 12 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8666/version'
```

#### Response:

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "version": "2.3.0-next"
}
```

### Cygnus - Checking Service Health

Once **Cygnus** is running, you can check the status by making an HTTP request to the exposed `CYGNUS_API_PORT` port. If
the response is blank, this is usually because **Cygnus** is not running or is listening on another port.

#### 13 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:5080/v1/version'
```

#### Response:

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "success": "true",
    "version": "1.8.0_SNAPSHOT.ed50706880829e97fd4cf926df434f1ef4fac147"
}
```

> **Troubleshooting:** What if either response is blank ?
>
> -   To check that a docker container is running try
>
> ```
> docker ps
> ```
>
> You should see several containers running. If `sth-comet` or `cygnus` is not running, you can restart the containers
> as necessary.

### Generating Context Data

For the purpose of this tutorial, we must be monitoring a system where the context is periodically being updated. The
dummy IoT Sensors can be used to do this. Open the device monitor page at `http://localhost:3000/device/monitor` and
unlock a **Smart Door** and switch on a **Smart Lamp**. This can be done by selecting an appropriate the command from
the drop-down list and pressing the `send` button. The stream of measurements coming from the devices can then be seen
on the same page:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Short-Term-History/img/door-open.gif)

## _formal_ mode - Subscribing Cygnus to Context Changes

In _formal_ mode, **Cygnus** is responsible for the persistence of historic context data. Once a dynamic context system
is up and running, we need to set up a subscription in the **Orion Context Broker** to notify **Cygnus** of changes in
context - **STH-Comet** will only be used to read the persisted data.

### Cygnus - Aggregate Motion Sensor Count Events

The rate of change of the **Motion Sensor** is driven by events in the real-world. We need to receive every event to be
able to aggregate the results.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the **Orion Context Broker**.

-   The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to
    measurements from the attached IoT Sensors.
-   The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that **Cygnus** will be informed of all **Motion Sensor** data changes.
-   The notification `url` must match the configured `CYGNUS_MONGO_SERVICE_PORT`.

#### 14 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Notify Cygnus of all Motion Sensor count changes",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "idPattern": "Motion.*"
      }
    ],
    "condition": {
      "attrs": [
        "count"
      ]
    }
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://cygnus:5051/notify"
    },
    "attrs": [
      "count"
    ]
  }
}'
```

### Cygnus - Sample Lamp Luminosity

The luminosity of the **Smart Lamp** is constantly changing, we only need to **sample** the values to be able to work
out relevant statistics such as minimum and maximum values and rates of change.

This is done by making a POST request to the `/v2/subscription` endpoint of the **Orion Context Broker** and including
the `throttling` attribute in the request body.

-   The `fiware-service` and `fiware-servicepath` headers are used to filter the subscription to only listen to
    measurements from the attached IoT Sensors.
-   The `idPattern` in the request body ensures that **Cygnus** will be informed of all **Smart Lamp** data changes
    only.
-   The notification `url` must match the configured `CYGNUS_MONGO_SERVICE_PORT`.
-   The `throttling` value defines the rate that changes are sampled.

#### 15 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
  "description": "Notify Cygnus to sample Lamp luminosity every five seconds",
  "subject": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "idPattern": "Lamp.*"
      }
    ],
    "condition": {
      "attrs": [
        "luminosity"
      ]
    }
  },
  "notification": {
    "http": {
      "url": "http://cygnus:5051/notify"
    },
    "attrs": [
      "luminosity"
    ]
  },
  "throttling": 5
}'
```

## _formal_ mode - Time Series Data Queries

When reading data from the database, there is no difference between _minimal_ and _formal_ mode, please refer to the
previous section of this tutorial to request time-series data from **STH-Comet**

## Accessing Time Series Data Programmatically

Once the JSON response for a specified time series has been retrieved, displaying the raw data is of little use to an
end user. It must be manipulated to be displayed in a bar chart, line graph or table listing. This is not within the
domain of **STH-Comet** as it not a graphical tool, but can be delegated to a mashup or dashboard component such as
[Wirecloud](https://github.com/FIWARE/catalogue/blob/master/processing/README.md#Wirecloud) or
[Knowage](https://github.com/FIWARE/catalogue/blob/master/processing/README.md#Knowage).

It can also be retrieved and displayed using a third-party graphing tool appropriate to your coding environment - for
example [chartjs](http://www.chartjs.org/). An example of this can be found within the `history` controller in the
[Git Repository](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Step-by-Step/blob/master/context-provider/controllers/history.js).

The basic processing consists of two-step - retrieval and attribute mapping, sample code can be seen below:

```javascript
function readCometLampLuminosity(id, aggMethod) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        const url = 'http://sth-comet:8666/STH/v1/contextEntities/type/Lamp/id/Lamp:001/attributes/luminosity';
        const options = {
            method: 'GET',
            url: url,
            qs: { aggrMethod: aggMethod, aggrPeriod: 'minute' },
            headers: {
                'fiware-servicepath': '/',
                'fiware-service': 'openiot'
            }
        };

        request(options, (error, response, body) => {
            return error ? reject(error) : resolve(JSON.parse(body));
        });
    });
}
```

```javascript
function cometToTimeSeries(cometResponse, aggMethod) {
    const data = [];
    const labels = [];

    const values = cometResponse.contextResponses[0].contextElement.attributes[0].values[0];
    let date = moment(values._id.origin);

    _.forEach(values.points, (element) => {
        data.push({ t: date.valueOf(), y: element[aggMethod] });
        labels.push(date.format('HH:mm'));
        date = date.clone().add(1, 'm');
    });

    return {
        labels,
        data
    };
}
```

The modified data is then passed to the frontend to be processed by the third-party graphing tool. The result is shown
here: `http://localhost:3000/device/history/urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`.
