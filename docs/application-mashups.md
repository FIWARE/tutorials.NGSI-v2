**Description:** This tutorial is an introduction to [FIWARE Wirecloud](https://Wirecloud.rtfd.io) - a generic enabler
visualization tool which allows end users without programming skills to create web applications and dashboards to
visualize their NGSI data. The tutorial explains how to create a Wirecloud workspace and upload widget to visualise the
data. Once the widgets are configured the data is displayed on screen

The tutorial demonstrates examples of interactions using the Wirecloud GUI only. No programming is involved within the
tutorial itself, as Wirecloud is designed to be usable by all type of user, even those with limited programming skills.
However, the commentary continues to reference various programming principles and standard concepts common to all FIWARE
architectures.

Additional materials covering how to develop and create your own widgets will be the subject of a later tutorial.

# Visualizing NGSI Data using a Mashup

> "One picture is worth a thousand words."
>
> — Fred R. Barnard (Printers' Ink)

As a Smart Solution evolves, it is necessary to be able to analyse and understand the current system context, so that
appropriate decisions can be made. An obvious first step of data analysis is to display context data on screen. At this
stage it is not necessarily known which context data is relevant and how it would be best displayed to the end user.
Flexible rapid prototyping is required to be able to refine, enhance and manipulate the data, display and tweak the
visualizations, and add further information as necessary.

An **application mashup** is a web application which uses content from multiple sources to display a single new service
with a graphical interface. Most mashups are visual and interactive by design, and many are short-lived representations
which are only required to help analyse a single problem.

The [FIWARE Wirecloud](https://Wirecloud.rtfd.io) Generic Enabler is a tool which helps users to rapidly generate new
application mashups based on NGSI and other data sources. To speed up development, the Wirecloud architecture has been
defined to split mashup operations into a series of simple reusable tasks (widgets and operators). Each task has
well-defined input and output interfaces, and the Wirecloud UI allows mashup creators to wire up a series of tasks into
a complex chain of data processing and visualization events.

Broadly speaking application mashup tasks can be split into four categories:

-   **Data sources**: These are operators that provide information for consumption elsewhere. For example, an operator
    that retrieves some type of information from an NGSI web service.
-   **Data targets**: The reverse of the above. These operators push information out to an external microservice.
-   **Data transformers**: This type of operator manipulates data in order to make it usable by other tasks further down
    the chain within the Wirecloud ecosystem. For example, transposing form list values or renaming attributes to align
    with an input interface downstream.
-   **Visual Components**: Combinations of HTML and JavaScript which display data on a browser online. Within Wirecloud,
    visual components are known as widgets.

The overall aim of Wirecloud is to allow someone without a programming background to be able to create data
visualizations using a drag-and-drop interface. A wide range of existing open-source
[Wirecloud Widgets and Operators](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/widgets/) are already available and can be
used to create complex visualizations.

The existing [widget and operator set](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/widgets/) covers a wide range of
scenarios, but can be complemented by your own additional widgets. A background in JavaScript and HTML is necessary in
this case. Creating your own widgets will be the subject of a subsequent tutorial.

Once a mashup has been wired up and created it can be also be shared wholesale with end users.

## Architecture

This application adds the **Wirecloud** application mashup into the existing Stock Management and Sensors-based
application created in [previous tutorials](iot-agent.md). The aim of the tutorial is to be able to monitor devices and
wire-up a simple supermarket finder. This monitoring tool mashup will be able to duplicate and replace much of the
visualisation functionality already found in the tutorial application itself (which is written in PUG, Node.JS and
JavaScript). The aim is to create an equivalent application without resorting to writing a line of code.

The Users in **Wirecloud** have been created using the standard [identity management](identity-management.md) component,
**Keyrock**. Overall the system makes use of four FIWARE components - the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),the
[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the
[Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Identity Manager and the newly integrated
[Wirecloud](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) application mashup tool. Usage of the Orion Context Broker is
sufficient for an application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_.

Therefore, the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The FIWARE [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2).
-   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive
    southbound requests using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) and convert them to
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    commands for the devices.
-   The FIWARE [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Identity Management System:
    -   Used by both the **Stock Management System** and **Wirecloud**.
-   FIWARE [Wirecloud](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) an application mashup tool for displaying NGSI
    entities.
-   Three databases:

    -   A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database:
        -   Used by **Wirecloud** to hold mashup state.
    -   A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database:
        -   Used by **Keyrock** to persist user identities, applications, roles and permissions.
    -   A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database:
        -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions
            and registrations.
        -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys.

-   The **Stock Management Frontend** does the following:
    -   Displays store information.
    -   Shows which products can be bought at each store.
    -   Allows users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.
-   A webserver acting as set of [dummy IoT devices](iot-sensors.md) using the
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    protocol running over HTTP - access to certain resources is restricted.
-   Three additional microservices are used by **Wirecloud**:
    -   [Memcache](https://memcached.org), a general-purpose distributed memory caching system.
    -   [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), a full-text search engine.
    -   [NGSI Proxy](https://github.com/conwetlab/ngsi-proxy), a server that is capable of redirecting **Orion**
        notifications to web pages.

Since all interactions between the services are initiated by HTTP requests, the services can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

The specific architecture of each section of the tutorial is discussed below.

<h3>Wirecloud Configuration</h3>

```yaml

        volumes:
            - wirecloud-data:/opt/wirecloud_instance/data
            - wirecloud-static:/var/www/static
```

The `wirecloud` container is a web application server listening on a single port:

-   Port `8000` has been exposed for HTTP traffic so we can display the web page.

The `wirecloud` container is connecting to **Keyrock** and is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key                       | Value                                  | Description                                                                          |

## Start Up

To start the installation, do the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Application-Mashup.git
cd tutorials.Application-Mashup
git checkout NGSI-v2

./services create
```

> **Note** The initial creation of Docker images can take up to three minutes

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Application-Mashup/blob/master/services) Bash script provided within the
repository:

```bash
./services start
```

Then go to your browser and open **Wirecloud** using the URL: `http://localhost:8000/`.

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

## Log in

**Wirecloud** is enabled for Oauth2 security, and as mentioned previously, user an admin user has already been created
for the **Wirecloud** application. To start creating a mashup, click on the **Sign in** button on the top right of the
page and sign in to **Keyrock** using `alice-the-admin@test.com` with the password `test`.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/login.png)

> **Note:** if you want to see how Alice has been authorized to use **Wirecloud**, you can Log in to **Keyrock** itself,
> and look at Alice's applications (`http://localhost:3005/idm/applications`)
>
> The **Wirecloud** application is set up as follows:
>
> -   URL: `http://localhost:8000`.
> -   Callback: `http://localhost:8000/complete/fiware/`.
> -   The application has one single role called `admin`.
> -   The `admin` role has a single blank permission.
> -   The `admin` role has been assigned to Alice.

## Adding Resources to Wirecloud

As noted above, **Wirecloud** relies on widgets and operators to connect to NGSI sources, manipulate data and display
something on screen. As a first step these widgets (`*.wgt`) must be uploaded into **Wirecloud**. It is possible to do
this programmatically, but for this tutorial, the user is directed to upload widgets manually.

## Upload Widgets

To upload resources click on the **My Resources** button:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/my-resources-button.png)

A series of resources may already be available, however for this tutorial additional widgets and operators are required.
Click on the **Upload** button.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/upload-button.png)

Then and click on **Select files from your computer**.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/upload-widgets.png)

Sources of Wirecloud Widgets can be found on the
[Wirecloud Marketplace](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/#browsing-the-marketplace). Alternatively
individual Widget binaries (`*.wgt`) can be downloaded directly from available releases on GitHub. A list of common
widgets and their location can be found in the appendix to the
[Wirecloud documentation](https://wirecloud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/widgets/).

Navigate to the root of this repository and select all the files found in the `widgets` directory as shown:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/upload-components-list.png)

Clicking on upload will add the resources to **Wirecloud**.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/my-resources.png)

Just click on any available widget to obtain a summary of the widget's usage. More details about the available inputs
and outputs and how to wire up each widget can do can be found in the widget's documentation.

To return to the homepage, click on the back button:
![.](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/back-button.png)

## Creating a Workspace

Individual mashups are created in different workspaces, allowing the user to offer separate views with different URLs.
To create a workspace click on the hamburger button and select new workspace.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/new-workspace.png)

Fill in the dialog as shown to create an empty workspace.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/create-workspace.png)

The workspace will open. The URL in the browser bar will alter to `http://localhost:8000/<user>/<workspace>`.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/workspace.png)

The workspace will also be added to the list of available workspaces found under the hamburger button. Any available
workspace can be selected on click:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/selecting-a-workspace.png)

You can return to the homepage by selecting the back button:

![.](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/back-button.png)

## Creating Application Mashups

An application mashup can be created by adding widgets to a workspace. At a minimum there must be one data source and
one visual component, but some widgets combine these functions into a single browser widget.

More complex mashups will consist of a series of widgets and operations linked together using wirecloud wiring.

## Creating a simple Mashup

The _Hello World_ of Wirecloud components involves adding a single browser widget on screen and then configuring it to
display some context data.

As you would expect, this tutorial relies on context data from the context broker. To ensure that the IoT devices are
running, open the tutorial application (`http://localhost:3000/`) in a new browser window. Log in as
`bob-the-manager@test.com` with the password `test` and click on device monitor. Bob can switch on the lamp to obtain
some context data for the mashup.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/devices-lamp-on.png)

### Selecting Widgets and Operators

Click the **Edit** button to switch the workspace to edit mode, then click on the **Find Components** button to add a
widget or operator to the workspace:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/wiring-view.png)

The components' sidebar will be displayed.

### NGSI Browser Widget

Since we require a visual component, in the components sidebar select **Widgets** and then scroll down until you find
the NGSI Browser:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-browser-widget.png)

Clicking on the **+** button will add an unconfigured NGSI Browser on screen.

> **Note:** the widget can be removed by clicking on the **x** at the top right of the window

The next step is to configure the widget. Click on the wiring button to switch to the wiring view, and select
**Widgets** from the components sidebar. Scrolling down to the NGSI browser shows an available widget in orange:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-browser-wiring.png)

Clicking on the orange button brings up the settings to configure. Select the hamburger to obtain a dropdown and click
on settings to configure as shown:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-browser-settings.png)

Then click on **Accept**.

Click on the back button to return to the workspace view:

![.](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/back-button.png)

The NGSI browser should be displaying live data as shown:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-browser-ui.png)

## Combining Multiple Widgets within a Mashup

The simple widget in the example above give combines both input and output into a single component, but it is when a
series of operators and widgets are **combined** that the true power of Wirecloud can be seen. Simple data flows can be
mapped graphically on screen and a mashup can be created by a user with minimal understanding of the technologies used
to create the mashup.

### Selecting Widgets and Operators

From the workspace page, click on edit and then click on the jigsaw button to bring up the wiring editor view.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/add-components.png)

Then click on add components to bring up the components sidebar. We will require a combination of both **Operators** and
**Widgets**.

Click on the **operators** tab, and select an instance of _NGSI Source_ and an instance of _NGSI-Entity-to-POI_ by
pressing the **+** button. A green bar will appear below each entry which can be dragged-and-dropped onto the wiring
editor view.

Then click on the **Widgets** tab and add an instance of the _Open Layers Map_ Widget and drag it onto the wiring editor
view.

| Operators                                                                         | Widgets                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/operators-list.png) | ![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/components-widgets.png) |

The result is a series of unconnected components on screen.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/osm-unwired.png)

Hovering over the connectors will give more information about the available inputs and outputs. Click and drag to
connect the elements as shown.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/osm-wired.png)

You can see that flow of data can be visualized on screen, in the mashup we wish to display Points of Interest (_POIs_)
on screen. In order to do this we will receive data _entities_ from an NGSI source, the data from each _entity_ will be
converted into a _POI_. Finally, each _POI_ will be inserted onto the _OpenLayers Map_.

### NGSI Source Operator

The _NGSI Source_ operator allows you to connect to an Orion Context Broker and use it as source of data. This is
accomplished by creating a subscription to obtain real time notifications about changes on the entities of interest. It
is an example of a data source component.

Full details of the operator documentation can be found within the running application under the **My Resources**
screen:
`http://localhost:8000/wirecloud/home#view=myresources&subview=details&resource=CoNWeT%2Fngsi-source%2F4.0.0&tab=Documentation`

To configure the component, click on the _NGSI Source_ hamburger button and select settings:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-source-wiring.png)

Amend the settings as shown below and click accept.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-source-settings.png)

-   The NGSI server needs to be the location of the Orion Context Broker.
-   The NGSI proxy is used to bypass CORS issues when accessing webservices using JavaScript. This is a simple endpoint
    which ensures that the Orion Context Broker is only accessed via a server-side API call.
-   User credentials and workspace credentials should be left unchecked.
-   The FIWARE service and service path match the data found within the Orion Context Broker.
-   ID pattern, Query and Monitored Attributes can be left blank.

### NGSI Entity to POI Operator

The _NGSI Entity to POI_ operator transforms NGSI entities to Points of Interest. It is an example of a data
manipulation component. To be able to do so, those entities should contain an attribute containing the coordinates of
the entity. Also, take into account the fact this operator is generic, so marker bubbles of the PoIs created by this
operator will be a mere composition of the attribute/value pairs.

Full details of the operator documentation can be found within the running application under the **My Resources**
screen:
`http://localhost:8000/wirecloud/home#view=myresources&subview=details&resource=CoNWeT%2Fngsientity2poi%2F3.1.2&tab=Documentation`

To configure the component, click on the _NGSI Entity to POI_ hamburger button and select settings:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-to-poi-wiring.png)

Amend the coordinates setting as shown below and click accept:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/ngsi-to-poi-settings.png)

According to the Smart Data Models [Guidelines](https://smartdatamodels.org/) an attribute called `location` should be
used for geographical coordinates. Coordinates should be encoded using GeoJSON. Since this convention has been used for
the tutorial data, the widget knows how to extract a location from the `Store` entity.

### Open Layers Map Widget

The _Open Layers Map_ Widget allows a user to display geographic data onto an [Open Layers](https://openlayers.org/)
map. It is an example of a visual component. Open Layers is a free, open-source JavaScript library, released under the
[2-clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).

Full details of the widget documentation can be found within the running application under the **My Resources** screen:
`http://localhost:8000/wirecloud/home#view=myresources&subview=details&resource=CoNWeT%2Fol3-map%2F1.1.2&tab=Documentation`.

To configure the component, click on the _Open Layers Map_ hamburger button and select settings:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/osm-wiring.png)

Amend the settings as shown below and click accept:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/osm-settings.png)

The Store Data is found in Berlin. This city is located at 52.53N, 13.4E. The initial location setting is defined in
Long/Lat format. The other settings help to display the map over the right part of the globe.

The updated mashup can be seen on the workspace tab (refresh the browser if necessary).

`http://localhost:8000/alice/test#view=workspace&tab=tab`

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/osm-map-result.png)

Clicking on the POIs retrieves additional data from each store.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Application-Mashup/img/osm-map-on-click.png)

Currently, the data is displayed as unformatted JSON. This is because the `Store` context data entities with the
tutorial example are not using a standard FIWARE data model. If a standard data model such as
[Building](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Building) had been used the data would be formatted in an
appropriate manner and a **Building** specific icon would be used.
