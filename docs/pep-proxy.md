[![FIWARE Security](https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/repository/raw/public/badges/chapters/security.svg)](https://github.com/FIWARE/catalogue/blob/master/security/README.md)

**Description:** This tutorial uses a PEP Proxy combined with the Keyrock to secure access to endpoints exposed by
FIWARE generic enablers. Users (or other actors) must log in and use a token to gain access to the services. The
application code created in the [previous tutorial](securing-access.md) is expanded to authenticate users throughout a
distributed system. The design of FIWARE Wilma - a PEP Proxy is discussed, and the parts of the Keyrock GUI and REST API
relevant to authenticating other services are described in detail.

[cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands are used throughout to access the **Keyrock** and **Wilma** REST APIs -
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/) for these calls is also available.

# Securing Microservices with a PEP Proxy

> "Oh, it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password, and the doors will open."
>
> — Gandalf (The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R Tolkein)

The [previous tutorial](securing-access.md) demonstrated that it is possible to Permit or Deny access to resources based
on an authenticated user identifying themselves within an application. It was simply a matter of the code following a
different line of execution if the `access_token` was not found (Level 1 - _Authentication Access_), or confirming that
a given `access_token` had appropriate rights (Level 2 - _Basic Authorization_). The same method of securing access can
be applied by placing a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) in front of other services within a FIWARE-based Smart Solution.

A **PEP Proxy** lies in front of a secured resource and is an endpoint found at "well-known" public location. It serves
as a gatekeeper for resource access. Users or other actors must supply sufficient information to the **PEP Proxy** to
allow their request to succeed and pass through the **PEP proxy**. The **PEP proxy** then passes the request on to the
real location of the secured resource itself - the actual location of the secured resource is unknown to the outside
user - it could be held in a private network behind the **PEP proxy** or found on a different machine altogether.

FIWARE [Wilma](https://fiware-pep-proxy.rtfd.io/) is a simple implementation of a **PEP proxy** designed to work with
the FIWARE [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Generic Enabler. Whenever a user tries to gain access
to the resource behind the **PEP proxy**, the PEP will describe the user's attributes to the Policy Decision Point
(PDP), request a security decision, and enforce the decision. (Permit or Deny). There is minimal disruption of access
for authorized users - the response received is the same as if they had accessed the secured service directly.
Unauthorized users are simply returned a **401 - Unauthorized** response.

## Standard Concepts of Identity Management

The following common objects are found with the **Keyrock** Identity Management database:

-   **User** - Any signed-up user able to identify themselves with an eMail and password. Users can be assigned rights
    individually or as a group.
-   **Application** - Any securable FIWARE application consisting of a series of microservices.
-   **Organization** - A group of users who can be assigned a series of rights. Altering the rights of the organization
    effects the access of all users of that organization.
-   **OrganizationRole** - Users can either be members or admins of an organization - Admins are able to add and remove
    users from their organization, members merely gain the roles and permissions of an organization. This allows each
    organization to be responsible for their members and removes the need for a super-admin to administer all rights.
-   **Role** - A role is a descriptive bucket for a set of permissions. A role can be assigned to either a single user
    or an organization. A signed-in user gains all the permissions from all of their own roles plus all the roles
    associated to their organization.
-   **Permission** - An ability to do something on a resource within the system.

Additionally, two further non-human application objects can be secured within a FIWARE application:

-   **IoTAgent** - a proxy between IoT Sensors and the Context Broker.
-   **PEPProxy** - a middleware for use between generic enablers challenging the rights of a user.

The relationship between the objects can be seen below - the entities marked in red are used directly within this
tutorial:

## Architecture

This application protects access to the existing Stock Management and Sensors-based application by adding PEP Proxy
instances around the services created in previous tutorials and uses data pre-populated into the **MySQL** database used
by **Keyrock**. It will make use of four FIWARE components - the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),the
[IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the
[Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Generic enabler and adds one or two instances
[Wilma](https://fiware-pep-proxy.rtfd.io/) PEP Proxy dependent upon which interfaces are to be secured. Usage of the
Orion Context Broker is sufficient for an application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_.

Both the Orion Context Broker and the IoT Agent rely on open source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to
keep persistence of the information they hold. We will also be using the dummy IoT devices created in the
[previous tutorial](iot-sensors.md). **Keyrock** uses its own [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.

Therefore, the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The FIWARE [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2).
-   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive
    southbound requests using [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2) and convert them to
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    commands for the devices.
-   FIWARE [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) offer a complement Identity Management System
    including:
    -   An OAuth2 authentication system for Applications and Users.
    -   A site graphical frontend for Identity Management Administration.
    -   An equivalent REST API for Identity Management via HTTP requests.
-   FIWARE [Wilma](https://fiware-pep-proxy.rtfd.io/) is a PEP Proxy securing access to the **Orion** and/or **IoT
    Agent** microservices.
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations.
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys.
-   A [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database :
    -   Used to persist user identities, applications, roles and permissions.
-   The **Stock Management Frontend** does the following:
    -   Displays store information.
    -   Shows which products can be bought at each store.
    -   Allows users to "buy" products and reduce the stock count.
    -   Allows authorized users into restricted areas.
-   A webserver acting as set of [dummy IoT devices](iot-sensors.md) using the
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    protocol running over HTTP - access to certain resources is restricted.

Since all interactions between the services are initiated by HTTP requests, the services can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

The specific architecture of each section of the tutorial is discussed below.

## Start Up

To start the installation, do the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.PEP-Proxy.git
cd tutorials.PEP-Proxy

./services create
```

> **Note** The initial creation of Docker images can take up to three minutes

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.PEP-PRoxy/blob/master/services) Bash script provided within the
repository:

```bash
./services <command>
```

Where `<command>` will vary depending upon the exercise we wish to activate.

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

<h3>Dramatis Personae</h3>

The following people at `test.com` legitimately have accounts within the Application:

-   Alice, she will be the Administrator of the **Keyrock** Application.
-   Bob, the Regional Manager of the supermarket chain - he has several store managers under him:
    -   Manager1
    -   Manager2
-   Charlie, the Head of Security of the supermarket chain - he has several store detectives under him:
    -   Detective1
    -   Detective2

| Name       | eMail                       | Password |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| alice      | `alice-the-admin@test.com`  | `test`   |
| bob        | `bob-the-manager@test.com`  | `test`   |
| charlie    | `charlie-security@test.com` | `test`   |
| manager1   | `manager1@test.com`         | `test`   |
| manager2   | `manager2@test.com`         | `test`   |
| detective1 | `detective1@test.com`       | `test`   |
| detective2 | `detective2@test.com`       | `test`   |

The following people at `example.com` have signed up for accounts, but have no reason to be granted access:

-   Eve - Eve the Eavesdropper.
-   Mallory - Mallory the malicious attacker.
-   Rob - Rob the Robber.

| Name    | eMail                 | Password |
| ------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| eve     | `eve@example.com`     | `test`   |
| mallory | `mallory@example.com` | `test`   |
| rob     | `rob@example.com`     | `test`   |

Two organizations have also been set up by Alice:

| Name       | Description                         | UUID                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Security   | Security Group for Store Detectives | `security-team-0000-0000-000000000000` |
| Management | Management Group for Store Managers | `managers-team-0000-0000-000000000000` |

One application, with appropriate roles and permissions has also been created:

| Key           | Value                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Client ID     | `tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp` |
| Client Secret | `tutorial-dckr-site-0000-clientsecret` |
| URL           | `http://localhost:3000`                |
| RedirectURL   | `http://localhost:3000/login`          |

To save time, the data creating users and organizations from the [previous tutorial](roles-permissions.md) has been
downloaded and is automatically persisted to the MySQL database on start-up so the assigned UUIDs do not change and the
data does not need to be entered again.

The **Keyrock** MySQL database deals with all aspects of application security including storing users, password etc.;
defining access rights and dealing with OAuth2 authorization protocols. The complete database relationship diagram can
be found [here](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Securing-Access/img/keyrock-db.png).

To refresh your memory about how to create users and organizations and applications, you can log in at
`http://localhost:3005/idm` using the account `alice-the-admin@test.com` with a password of `test`.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/img/keyrock-log-in.png)

and look around.

## Logging In to Keyrock using the REST API

Enter a username and password to enter the application. The default super-user has the values `alice-the-admin@test.com`
and `test`. The URL `https://localhost:3443/v1/auth/tokens` should also work in a secure system.

### Create Token with Password

The following example logs in using the Admin Super-User:

#### 1 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:3005/v1/auth/tokens' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "alice-the-admin@test.com",
  "password": "test"
}'
```

#### Response:

The response header returns an `X-Subject-token` which identifies who has logged on the application. This token is
required in all subsequent requests to gain access:

```text
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
X-Subject-Token: d848eb12-889f-433b-9811-6a4fbf0b86ca
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 138
ETag: W/"8a-TVwlWNKBsa7cskJw55uE/wZl6L8"
Date: Mon, 30 Jul 2018 12:07:54 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
```

```json
{
    "token": {
        "methods": ["password"],
        "expires_at": "2018-07-30T13:02:37.116Z"
    },
    "idm_authorization_config": {
        "level": "basic",
        "authzforce": false
    }
}
```

### Get Token Info

Once a user has logged in, the presence of a (time-limited) token is sufficient to find out more information about the
user.

You can use the long-lasting `X-Auth-token=aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa` to pretend to be Alice throughout this
tutorial. Both `{{X-Auth-token}}` and `{{X-Subject-token}}` can be set to the same value in the case that Alice is
making an enquiry about herself.

#### 2 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:3005/v1/auth/tokens' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Auth-token: {{X-Auth-token}}' \
  -H 'X-Subject-token: {{X-Subject-token}}'
```

#### Response:

The response will return the details of the associated user:

```json
{
    "access_token": "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "expires": "2036-07-30T12:04:45.000Z",
    "valid": true,
    "User": {
        "id": "aaaaaaaa-good-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "username": "alice",
        "email": "alice-the-admin@test.com",
        "date_password": "2018-07-30T11:41:14.000Z",
        "enabled": true,
        "admin": true
    }
}
```

## Managing PEP Proxies and IoT Agents

User accounts have been created in a [previous tutorial](identity-management.md). Non-human actors such as a PEP Proxy
can be set up in the same manner. The account for each PEP Proxy, IoT Agent or IoT Sensor will merely consist of a
Username and password linked to an application within Keyrock. PEP Proxy and IoT Agents accounts can be created by using
either the Keyrock GUI or by using the REST API.

## Video : Wilma PEP Proxy Configuration

Click on the image above to see a video about configuring the Wilma PEP Proxy using the **Keyrock** GUI.

## Managing PEP Proxies and IoT Agents - Start Up

To start the system run the following command:

```bash
./services orion
```

This will start up **Keyrock** with a series of users. There are already two existing applications and an existing PEP
Proxy Account associated with the application.

## PEP Proxy CRUD Actions

#### GUI

Once signed-in, users are able to create and update PEP Proxies associated to their applications for themselves.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/img/create-pep-proxy.png)

#### REST API

Alternatively, the standard CRUD actions are assigned to the appropriate HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PATCH and DELETE) under
the `/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies` endpoint.

### Create a PEP Proxy

To create a new PEP Proxy account within an application, send a POST request to the
`/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies` endpoint along with the `X-Auth-token` header from a previously logged
in administrative user.

#### 3 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:3005/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Auth-token: {{X-Auth-token}}'
```

#### Response:

Provided there is no previously existing PEP Proxy account associated with the application, a new account will be
created with a unique `id` and `password` and the values will be returned to the response.

```json
{
    "pep_proxy": {
        "id": "pep_proxy_ac80aaf8-0ac3-4bd8-8042-5e8f587679b7",
        "password": "pep_proxy_23d805e7-1b93-434a-8e69-0798dcdd6726"
    }
}
```

### Read PEP Proxy details

Making a GET request to the `/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies` endpoint will return the details of the
associated PEP Proxy Account. The `X-Auth-token` must be supplied in the headers.

#### 4 Request:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:3005/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies/' \
  -H 'X-Auth-token: {{X-Auth-token}}'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "pep_proxy": {
        "id": "pep_proxy_f84bcba2-3300-4f13-a4bb-7bdbd358b201",
        "oauth_client_id": "tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp"
    }
}
```

### Reset Password of a PEP Proxy

To renew the password of a PEP Proxy Account, make a PATCH request to the
`/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies` endpoint will return the details of the associated PEP Proxy Account.
The `X-Auth-token` must be supplied in the headers.

#### 5 Request:

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  'http://localhost:3005/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

```

#### Response:

The response returns a new password for the PEP Proxy Account:

```json
{
    "new_password": "pep_proxy_2bc8996e-29bf-4195-ac39-d1116e429602"
}
```

### Delete a PEP Proxy

An existing PEP Proxy Account can be deleted by making a DELETE request to the
`/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies` endpoint. The `X-Auth-token` must be supplied in the headers.

#### 6 Request:

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  'http://localhost:3005/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/pep_proxies' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Auth-token: {{X-Auth-token}}'
```

## IoT Agent CRUD Actions

#### GUI

In a similar manner to PEP Proxy creation, signed-in, users are able to create and update IoT Sensor Accounts associated
to their applications.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/img/create-iot-sensor.png)

#### REST API

Alternatively, the standard CRUD actions are assigned to the appropriate HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PATCH and DELETE) under
the `/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/iot_agents` endpoint.

### Create an IoT Agent

To create a new IoT Agent account within an application, send a POST request to the
`/v1/applications/{{application-id}}/iot_agents` endpoint along with the `X-Auth-token` header from a previously logged
in administrative user.

## Wilma PEP - Secure traffic between an Application and the Context Broker

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/img/pep-proxy-orion.png)

<h3>Securing Orion - Wilma PEP Proxy Configuration</h3>

The `orion-proxy` container is an instance of FIWARE **Wilma** listening on port `1027`, it is configured to forward
traffic to `orion` on port `1026`, which is the default port that the Orion Context Broker is listening to for NGSI
Requests.

```yaml
orion-proxy:
    image: quay.io/fiware/pep-proxy
    container_name: fiware-orion-proxy
    hostname: orion-proxy
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.10
    depends_on:
        - keyrock
    ports:
        - "1027:1027"
    expose:
        - "1027"
    environment:
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_HOST=orion
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_PORT=1026
        - PEP_PROXY_PORT=1027
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_HOST=keyrock
        - PEP_PROXY_HTTPS_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_AUTH_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_SSL_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_PORT=3005
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_ID=tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp
        - PEP_PROXY_USERNAME=pep_proxy_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        - PEP_PASSWORD=test
        - PEP_PROXY_PDP=idm
        - PEP_PROXY_MAGIC_KEY=1234
```

The `PEP_PROXY_APP_ID` and `PEP_PROXY_USERNAME` would usually be obtained by adding new entries to the application in
**Keyrock**, however, in this tutorial, they have been predefined by populating the **MySQL** database with data on
start-up.

The `orion-proxy` container is listening on a single port:

-   The PEP Proxy Port - `1027` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can request directly to
    the **Wilma** instance without being part of the same network.

Level 3 - _Advanced Authorization_.

<h3>Securing Orion - Application Configuration</h3>

The tutorial application has already been registered in **Keyrock**, programmatically the tutorial application will be
making requests to the **Wilma** PEP Proxy in front of the **Orion Conext Broker**. Every request must now include an
additional `access_token` header.

```yaml
tutorial-app:
    image: quay.io/fiware/tutorials.context-provider
    hostname: iot-sensors-app
    container_name: tutorial-app
    depends_on:
        - orion-proxy
        - iot-agent
        - keyrock
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.7
            aliases:
                - tutorial
    expose:
        - "3000"
        - "3001"
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
        - "3001:3001"
    environment:
        - "WEB_APP_PORT=3000"
        - "SECURE_ENDPOINTS=true"
        - "CONTEXT_BROKER=http://orion-proxy:1027/v2"
        - "KEYROCK_URL=http://localhost"
        - "KEYROCK_IP_ADDRESS=http://172.18.1.5"
        - "KEYROCK_PORT=3005"
        - "KEYROCK_CLIENT_ID=tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp"
        - "KEYROCK_CLIENT_SECRET=tutorial-dckr-site-0000-clientsecret"
        - "CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/login"
```

All of the `tutorial` container settings have been described in previous tutorials. One important change is necessary
however, rather than accessing **Orion** directly on the default port `1026` as shown in all previous tutorials, all
context broker traffic is now sent to `orion-proxy` on port `1027`. As a reminder, the relevant settings are detailed
below:

| Key                   | Value                                  | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WEB_APP_PORT          | `3000`                                 | Port used by web-app which displays the login screen & etc.                                    |
| KEYROCK_URL           | `http://localhost`                     | This is URL of the **Keyrock** Web frontend itself, used for redirection when forwarding users |
| KEYROCK_IP_ADDRESS    | `http://172.18.1.5`                    | This is URL of the **Keyrock** OAuth Communications                                            |
| KEYROCK_PORT          | `3005`                                 | This is the port that **Keyrock** is listening on.                                             |

| KEYROCK_CLIENT_SECRET | `tutorial-dckr-site-0000-clientsecret` | The Client Secret defined by Keyrock for this application                                      |
| CALLBACK_URL          | `http://localhost:3000/login`          | The callback URL used by Keyrock when a challenge has succeeded.                               |

Click on the image above to see a video about securing a REST API using the Wilma PEP Proxy.

### Wilma PEP Proxy - No Access to Orion without an Access Token

Secured Access can be ensured by requiring all requests to the secured service are made indirectly via a Wilma PEP Proxy
(in this case the PEP Proxy is found in front of the Context Broker). Requests must include an `X-Auth-Token`, failure
to present a valid token results in a denial of access.

#### 12 Request

If a request to the PEP Proxy is made without any access token as shown:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:1027/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001?options=keyValues
```

#### Response

The response is a **401 Unauthorized** error code, with the following explanation:

```text
Auth-token not found in request header
```

### Keyrock - User Obtains an Access Token

#### 13 Request

To log in to the application using the user-credentials flow send a POST request to **Keyock** using the `oauth2/token`
endpoint with the `grant_type=password`. For example to log-in as Alice the Admin:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:3005/oauth2/token' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dHV0b3JpYWwtZGNrci1zaXRlLTAwMDAteHByZXNzd2ViYXBwOnR1dG9yaWFsLWRja3Itc2l0ZS0wMDAwLWNsaWVudHNlY3JldA==' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data "username=alice-the-admin@test.com&password=test&grant_type=password"
```

#### Response

The response returns an access code to identify the user:

```json
{
    "access_token": "a7e22dfe2bd7d883c8621b9eb50797a7f126eeab",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "refresh_token": "05e386edd9f95ed0e599c5004db8573e86dff874"
}
```

This can also be done by entering the Tutorial Application on http:/localhost and logging in using any of the OAuth2
grants on the page. A successful log-in will return an access token.

### Wilma PEP Proxy - Accessing Orion with an Access Token

If a request to **Wilma** is made including a valid access token in the `X-Auth-Token` header as shown, the request is
permitted and the service behind the PEP Proxy (in this case the Orion Context Broker) will return the data as expected.

#### 14 Request

```bash
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:1027/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001?options=keyValues \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: {{X-Access-token}}'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001",
    "type": "Store",
    "address": {
        "streetAddress": "Bornholmer Straße 65",
        "addressRegion": "Berlin",
        "addressLocality": "Prenzlauer Berg",
        "postalCode": "10439"
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [13.3986, 52.5547]
    },
    "name": "Bösebrücke Einkauf"
}
```

## Securing Orion - Sample Code

When a User logs in to the application using the User Credentials Grant, an `access_token` is obtained which identifies
the User. The `access_token` is stored in session:

```javascript
function userCredentialGrant(req, res) {
    debug("userCredentialGrant");

    const email = req.body.email;
    const password = req.body.password;

    oa.getOAuthPasswordCredentials(email, password).then((results) => {
        req.session.access_token = results.access_token;
        return;
    });
}
```

For each subsequent request, the `access_token` is supplied in the `X-Auth-Token` Header:

```javascript
function setAuthHeaders(req) {
    const headers = {};
    if (req.session.access_token) {
        headers["X-Auth-Token"] = req.session.access_token;
    }
    return headers;
}
```

For example, when buying an item, two requests are made, the same `X-Auth-Token` Header must be added to each request -
therefore the User can be identified and access granted.

```javascript
async function buyItem(req, res) {
    const inventory = await retrieveEntity(
        req.params.inventoryId,
        {
            options: "keyValues",
            type: "InventoryItem"
        },
        setAuthHeaders(req)
    );
    const count = inventory.shelfCount - 1;

    await updateExistingEntityAttributes(
        req.params.inventoryId,
        { shelfCount: { type: "Integer", value: count } },
        {
            type: "InventoryItem"
        },
        setAuthHeaders(req)
    );
    res.redirect(`/app/store/${inventory.refStore}/till`);
}
```

## Kong PEP - Secure traffic between an Application and the Context Broker

FIWARE is not limited to using a single security stack. Since the authorization token is held in a header, security is
effectively orthogonal to processing of a context broker, and the developer is free to chose their preferred Identity
Manager, PDP and PEP. As an example, we can swap out the Wilma PEP Proxy and use the [Kong](https://konghq.com/) API
Management tool in coordination with a [Kong Plugin](https://github.com/FIWARE/kong-plugins-fiware) for Keyrock.

<h3>Securing Orion - Kong PEP Proxy Configuration</h3>

The `kong-api-gateway` container is an instance of **Kong** listening on port `8000`, it includes a plugin to use
**Keyrock** as a PDP and is configured to forward traffic to `orion` on port `1026`, which is the default port that the
Orion Context Broker is listening to for NGSI Requests.

```yaml
kong-api-gateway:
    image: quay.io/fiware/kong
    container_name: fiware-orion-kong
    hostname: orion-proxy
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.10
    ports:
        - "8000:8000/tcp"
    environment:
        - KONG_DATABASE=off
        - KONG_DECLARATIVE_CONFIG=/etc/kong/kong.yaml
        - KONG_PLUGINS=bundled,pep-plugin
        - KONG_PLUGINSERVER_NAMES= pep-plugin
        - "KONG_PLUGINSERVER_PEP_PLUGIN_QUERY_CMD=/go-plugins/pep-plugin -dump"
        - "KONG_PLUGINSERVER_PEP_PLUGIN_START_CMD=/go-plugins/pep-plugin"
        - KONG_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

The declarative config holds additional information such as the hostname and location of the `keyrock`PDP and the name
and port of the proxied broker (`orion`)

```yaml
services:
    - host: "orion"
      name: "orion-oidc"
      port: 1026
      protocol: http
      routes:
          - name: orion-oidc
            paths:
                - /orion
            strip_path: true
      plugins:
          - name: pep-plugin
            config:
                authorizationendpointtype: Keyrock
                authorizationendpointaddress: http://keyrock:3005/user/
                keyrockappid: tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp
                pathprefix: /orion
```

The `keyrockappid` would usually be obtained by adding a new entry to the application in **Keyrock**, however, in this
tutorial, they have been predefined by populating the **MySQL** database with data on start-up.

The `kong-api-gateway` container is listening on a single port:

-   The API Gateway Port - `8000` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can make requests
    directly to the **Kong** instance without being part of the same network.

This Docker image of **Kong** is generated to include several FIWARE specific plugins.
[Kong Plugins](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/) enable the gateway to be extended and apply multiple security mechanisms.

<h2>Securing Orion - Start up</h2>

To start the system with a Kong API Gateway protecting access to **Orion**, run the following command:

```console
./services orion-kong
```

### Kong PEP Proxy - No Access to Orion without an Access Token

Secured Access can be ensured by requiring all requests to the secured service are made indirectly via the API Gateway.
Due to the manner in which Kong has been configured in the `kong.yaml`, all Context Broker access can be made under the
path `/orion` - for example to retrieve all entities a user would use `http://localhost:8000/orion/v2/entities/` (in
this case Kong is acting as a PEP Proxy is found in front of the Context Broker).

Successful requests must include an `Authentiction` header, failure to present a valid token results in a denial of
access.

#### 16 Request:

If a request to **Kong** is made without any access token as shown:

```console
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8000/orion/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001?options=keyValues
```

#### Response:

The response is a **401 Unauthorized** error code, with the following explanation:

```
Request forbidden by authorization service Keyrock.
```

### Keyrock - User Obtains an Access Token

#### 17 Request:

To log in to the application using the user-credentials flow send a POST request to **Keyrock** using the `oauth2/token`
endpoint with the `grant_type=password`. For example to log-in as Alice the Admin:

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:3005/oauth2/token' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dHV0b3JpYWwtZGNrci1zaXRlLTAwMDAteHByZXNzd2ViYXBwOnR1dG9yaWFsLWRja3Itc2l0ZS0wMDAwLWNsaWVudHNlY3JldA==' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data "username=alice-the-admin@test.com&password=test&grant_type=password"
```

#### Response:

The response returns an access code to identify the user:

```json
{
    "access_token": "a7e22dfe2bd7d883c8621b9eb50797a7f126eeab",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "refresh_token": "05e386edd9f95ed0e599c5004db8573e86dff874"
}
```

This can also be done by entering the Tutorial Application on http:/localhost and logging in using any of the OAuth2
grants on the page. A successful log-in will return an access token.

### Kong PEP Proxy - Accessing Orion with an Access Token

If a request to **Kong** is made including a valid access token in the `X-Auth-Token` header as shown, the request is
permitted and the service behind the PEP Proxy (in this case the Orion Context Broker) will return the data as expected.

#### 18 Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8000/orion/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001?options=keyValues \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{X-Access-token}}'
```

#### Response:

```json

## Securing an IoT Agent South Port

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.PEP-Proxy/img/pep-proxy-south-port.png)

<h3>Securing an IoT Agent South Port - PEP Proxy Configuration</h3>

The `iot-agent-proxy` container is an instance of FIWARE **Wilma** listening on port `7897`, it is configured to forward
traffic to `iot-agent` on port `7896`, which is the default port that the Ultralight agent is listening to for HTTP
Requests.

```yaml
iot-agent-proxy:
    image: quay.io/fiware/pep-proxy
    container_name: fiware-iot-agent-proxy
    hostname: iot-agent-proxy
    networks:
        default:
            ipv4_address: 172.18.1.11
    depends_on:
        - keyrock
    ports:
        - "7897:7897"
    expose:
        - "7897"
    environment:
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_HOST=iot-agent
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_PORT=7896
        - PEP_PROXY_PORT=7897
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_HOST=keyrock
        - PEP_PROXY_HTTPS_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_AUTH_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_SSL_ENABLED=false
        - PEP_PROXY_IDM_PORT=3005
        - PEP_PROXY_APP_ID=tutorial-dckr-site-0000-xpresswebapp
        - PEP_PROXY_USERNAME=pep_proxy_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        - PEP_PASSWORD=test
        - PEP_PROXY_PDP=idm
        - PEP_PROXY_MAGIC_KEY=1234
```

The `PEP_PROXY_APP_ID` and `PEP_PROXY_USERNAME` would usually be obtained by adding new entries to the application in
**Keyrock**, however, in this tutorial, they have been predefined by populating the **MySQL** database with data on
start-up.

The `iot-agent-proxy` container is listening on a single port:

-   The PEP Proxy Port - `7897` is exposed purely for tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can request directly to
    this **Wilma** instance without being part of the same network.

For this example, the PEP Proxy is checking for Level 1 - _Authentication Access_ not Level 2 - _Basic Authorization_ or
Level 3 - _Advanced Authorization_.

<h3>Securing an IoT Agent South Port - Application Configuration</h3>

The tutorial application also plays the role of providing data from our dummy IoT Sensors. The IoT Sensors are making
HTTP request containing commands and measurements in Ultralight syntax. An IoT Sensor username and password have already
been registered in **Keyrock**, programmatically each sensor must obtain an OAuth2 access token and will then make
requests to a second **Wilma** PEP Proxy in front of the **IoT Agent**.

```yaml
tutorial-app:
    image: quay.io/fiware/tutorials.context-provider
    hostname: iot-sensors-app
    container_name: tutorial-app
    depends_on:
        - orion-proxy
        - iot-agent-proxy
        - keyrock

    expose:
        - "3000"
        - "3001"
    ports:
        - "3000:3000"
        - "3001:3001"
    environment:
        - "IOTA_HTTP_HOST=iot-agent-proxy"
        - "IOTA_HTTP_PORT=7897"
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_PORT=3001" # Port used by the dummy IOT devices to receive commands
        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_TRANSPORT=HTTP" # Default transport used by dummy Io devices

        - "DUMMY_DEVICES_PASSWORD=test"
```

The `tutorial` container hosts the dummy Ultralight sensors. Rather than accessing the **IoT Agent** directly on port
`7896` as shown in all previous tutorials, all traffic is forwarded to `iot-agent-proxy` on port `7897`. Most of the
relevant `tutorial` container settings have been described in previous tutorials, the `DUMMY_DEVICES_USER` and
`DUMMY_DEVICES_PASSWORD` are new additions.

The `DUMMY_DEVICES_USER` and `DUMMY_DEVICES_PASSWORD` would usually be obtained by adding new entries to the application
in **Keyrock**, however, in this tutorial, they have been predefined by populating the **MySQL** database with data on
start-up.

<h2>Securing IoT Agent - Start up</h2>

To start the system with a PEP Proxies protecting access to both **Orion** and the **IoT Agent** run the following
command:

```bash
./services southport
```

## Secure traffic between an IoT Sensor and an IoT Agent

### Keyrock - IoT Sensor Obtains an Access Token

Logging in as an IoT Sensor follows the same user-credentials flow as for a User. To log in and identify the sensor
`iot_sensor_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` with password `test` send a POST request to **Keyock** using the
`oauth2/token` endpoint with the `grant_type=password`:

#### 19 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:3005/oauth2/token' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dHV0b3JpYWwtZGNrci1zaXRlLTAwMDAteHByZXNzd2ViYXBwOnR1dG9yaWFsLWRja3Itc2l0ZS0wMDAwLWNsaWVudHNlY3JldA==' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data "username=iot_sensor_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&password=test&grant_type=password"
```

#### Response

The response returns an access code to identify the device:

```json
{
    "access_token": "a7e22dfe2bd7d883c8621b9eb50797a7f126eeab",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "refresh_token": "05e386edd9f95ed0e599c5004db8573e86dff874"
}
```

### PEP Proxy - Accessing IoT Agent with an Access Token

This example simulates a secured request coming from the device `motion001`

The POST request to a PEP Proxy in front of the Ultralight IoT Agent identifies a previously provisioned resource
`iot/d`endpoint and passes a measurement for device `motion001`. The addition of the `X-Auth-Token` Header identifies
the source of the request as being registered in Keyrock, and therefore the measurement will be successfully passed on
to the IoT Agent itself.

#### 20 Request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://localhost:7896/iot/d?k=4jggokgpepnvsb2uv4s40d59ov&i=motion001' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: {{X-Access-token}}' \
  -d 'c|1'
```

## Securing an IoT Agent South Port - Sample Code

When an IoT Sensor starts up, it must log in like any other user to obtain an access token:

```javascript
const DUMMY_DEVICE_HTTP_HEADERS = { "Content-Type": "text/plain" };
```

```javascript
function initSecureDevices() {
    Security.oa
        .getOAuthPasswordCredentials(process.env.DUMMY_DEVICES_USER, process.env.DUMMY_DEVICES_PASSWORD)
        .then((results) => {
            DUMMY_DEVICE_HTTP_HEADERS["X-Auth-Token"] = results.access_token;
            return;
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            debug(error);
            return;
        });
}
```

Each HTTP request thereafter includes the `X-Auth-Token` Header in the request identifying the IoT Sensor:

```javascript
const options = {
    method: "POST",
    url: UL_URL,
    qs: { k: UL_API_KEY, i: deviceId },
    headers: DUMMY_DEVICE_HTTP_HEADERS,
    body: state
};

request(options, (error) => {
    if (error) {
        debug(debugText + " " + error.code);
    }
});
```

<h3>Securing an IoT Agent North Port - Start up</h3>

To start the system with a PEP Proxy protecting access to between **Orion** and the **IoT Agent** North Port run the
following command:

```bash
./services northport
```

## Secure traffic between an IoT Agent and the Context Broker

### Keyrock - Obtaining a permanent token

The Keyrock application has been configured to offer permanent tokens.

The standard `Authorization: Basic` header holds the base 64 concatenation of the client ID and secret. The parameter
`scope=permanent` is added to retrieve permanent tokens when available. The response contains an `access_token` which
can be used for device provisioning.

#### 21 Request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3005/oauth2/token \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic dHV0b3JpYWwtZGNrci1zaXRlLTAwMDAteHByZXNzd2ViYXBwOnR1dG9yaWFsLWRja3Itc2l0ZS0wMDAwLWNsaWVudHNlY3JldA==' \
  -d 'username=alice-the-admin@test.com&password=test&grant_type=password&scope=permanent'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "access_token": "e37aeef5d48c9c1a3d4adf72626a8745918d4355",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": ["permanent"]
}
```

### IoT Agent - provisioning a trusted service group

The Access token (also known as a Trust Token) must be added to the service group. The `resource` and `apikey`
correspond to the values set-up within the service group provisioning stage. In this case the Motion sensor group had
been provisioned as shown:

```json
{
    "apikey": "1068318794",
    "cbroker": "http://orion:1026",
    "entity_type": "Motion",
    "resource": "/iot/d"
}
```

#### 22 Request:

```bash
curl -iX PUT \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/services?resource=/iot/d&apikey=1068318794' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
     "cbroker": "http://orion-proxy:1027",
     "trust": "30a5ce4c71e416bd199dcdcb7f8bcd8d70e8bb5e"
}'
```

The Motion sensor requests are now sent via the `orion-proxy` and identify themselves using the generated trust token.

### IoT Agent - provisioning a sensor

Once a trusted service group has been created, a device can be provisioned in the usual manner.

#### 23 Request:

```bash
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:4041/iot/devices' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'fiware-service: openiot' \
  -H 'fiware-servicepath: /' \
  -d '{
 "devices": [
   {
     "device_id":   "motion001",
     "entity_name": "urn:ngsi-ld:Motion:001",
     "entity_type": "Motion",
     "timezone":    "Europe/Berlin",
     "attributes": [
